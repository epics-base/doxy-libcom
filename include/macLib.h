/**
 * @file macLib.h
 * @author William Lupton, W. M. Keck Observatory
 *
 * Describes a general purpose macro substitution library. 
 * It is used for all macro substitution in base.
 *
 * @note The directory \<base\>/src/libCom/macLib contains two Ô¨Åles 
 * macLibNOTES and macLibREADME that explain this library.
 *
 * @note Error handling on routines conforms 0 (=OK) for success,
 * -1 (=ERROR) for failure, and small positive values for extra info.
 *
 * "authors note": I contravened this for macGetValue() and macExpandString()
 * because I felt that it was worth returning information both on
 * success / failure and on value length. Errors and warnings are 
 * reported using errlogPrintf().

 * If the value contains macro references then the references will be
 * expanded recursively. This expansion will detect a direct or indirect
 * self reference.
 *
 * Macro references begin with a "$" immediately followed by either a
 * "(" or a "{" character. The macro name comes next, and may optionally
 * be succeeded by an "=" and a default value, which will be returned if

 * are, in order, "first name", "first value", "second name", "second
 * value" etc. The array is terminated with two NULL pointers and all
 * storage is allocated contiguously so that it can be freed with a
 * single call to free().

 * This routine is independent of any handle and provides a generally
 * useful service which may be used elsewhere. Any macro references in
 * values are not expanded at this point since the referenced macros may
 * be defined or redefined before the macro actually has to be
 * translated.
 *
 * Shell-style escapes and quotes are supported, as are things like
 * "A=B,B=$(C$(A)),CA=CA,CB=CB" (sets B to "CB"). White space is
 * significant within values but ignored elsewhere (i.e. surrounding "="
 * and "," characters).
 *
 * Probably noone will ever want to, but the special meanings of "$",
 * "{", "}", "(", ")", "=" and "," can all be changed via macPutXxxx()
 * calls.  This routine does not have a handle argument, so they must be
 * changed globally for it to use the new definitions. Should it have a
 * handle argument? This makes it more of a pain to use but guarantees
 * that there will be no conflicts. I think it should really.
 *
 * The function value is the number of definitions encountered, or -1 if
 * the supplied string is invalid.
