/**@file epicsEvent.h
 *
 * @brief Create an epicsEvent.
 *
 * Defines the C++ and C API's for a simple binary semaphore. If multiple threads are
 * waiting on the same event, only one of them will be woken when the event is signalled.
 *
 * The primary use of an event semaphore is for thread synchronization. An example of using an
 * event semaphore is a consumer thread that processes requests from one or more producer threads.
 * For example:
 *
 * When creating the consumer thread also create an epicsEvent.
 @code
   epicsEvent *pevent = new epicsEvent;
 @endcode
 * The consumer thread has code containing:
 @code
       while(1) {
           pevent->wait();
           while( {more work} ) {
               {process work}
           }
       }
 @endcode
 * Producers create requests and issue the statement:
 @code
       pevent->signal();
 @endcode
