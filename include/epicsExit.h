 * @brief Extended replacement for the Posix exit and atexit routines.
 *
 * This is an extended replacement for the Posix exit and atexit routines, which
 * also provides a pointer argument to pass to the exit handlers. This facility
 * was created because of problems on vxWorks and windows with the implementation
 * of atexit, i.e. neither of these systems implement exit and atexit according
 * to the POSIX standard.
